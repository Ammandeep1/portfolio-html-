      <h2>Multiplication Game</h2>
      <p>
        I created a multiplication game using Python and PySimpleGUI which allowed users to practice multiplication questions interactively. Unfortunately, this game no longer works as intended because the PySimpleGUI library has been discontinued, causing compatibility issues that prevent the game from running.

      <h2>Calculator Code Description</h2>
      <p>
        The calculator code is a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, exponentiation, factorial, and prime number checking. It uses functions to carry out each calculation and repeatedly prompts the user for input until they decide to stop. The program leverages Python’s built-in math library for factorial calculations and includes input validation to ensure users select valid operations.

      <h2>Website Project</h2>
      <p>
        I recently built a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The website showcases my career ambitions, educational background, skills, and achievements. The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and ease of navigation, with a consistent layout and visible navigation bar across pages. This project helped me develop my web development skills and create a professional online presence. This is also the website you are currently viewing.

      <h2>Leadership and Teamwork Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2022 and 2024, I served as Backstage Manager for Mill Park Secondary School productions, leading a team to ensure smooth backstage operations and effective communication. Additionally, in 2023, I was a pit crew member for the school’s Energy Breakthrough Challenge team, contributing to our vehicle's performance through teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure. These experiences strengthened my leadership, coordination, and collaborative skills.
