            <p>
                I’m a motivated 19-year-old currently studying a diploma followed by a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity at La Trobe University.
                Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for fitness, dedicating at least five days a week to the gym. This has played
                a significant role in building my emotional resilience, discipline, and interpersonal skills. I thrive in team environments and am known 
                for being hardworking and adaptable, with a natural ability to connect with others.
            </p>

            <p>
                My technical skills include proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, as well as a solid understanding of Microsoft Word and Excel—
                tools I have worked with since I was 10 years old. My last job was as a front-of-house team member at KFC, a role I left in 2023 
                to focus on my VCE studies. Most recently, I developed a math learning game that helps users practice times tables. 
                The game allows users to select numbers from 1 to 12 and cycles through different multiplication problems for targeted learning.
                This project not only enhanced my programming skills but also strengthened my problem-solving and user interface design abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                After completing my diploma and bachelor’s degree, I plan to join my brother at Commonwealth Bank as a cybersecurity personnel.
                I’m particularly interested in working on the policy side of cybersecurity, where I can help develop and enforce security protocols 
                to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with industry standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                My goal is to contribute to creating a safer digital environment within the banking sector, while continuously expanding 
                my knowledge and skills. Ultimately, I would like to grow into a leadership role where I can influence 
                security strategies on a larger scale and help shape the future of cybersecurity in the financial industry.
