        <p>
            I’m a motivated 19-year-old currently studying a diploma followed by a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity at La Trobe University. <br>
            Alongside my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for fitness, dedicating at least five days a week to the gym, which has played 
            a significant role in building my emotional resilience, discipline, and interpersonal skills. I thrive in team environments and am known 
            for being hardworking and adaptable, with a natural ability to connect with others. <br><br>
            My technical skills include proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, as well as a solid understanding of Microsoft Word and Excel—tools 
            I have been working with since I was 10 years old. My last job was working as a front-of-house team member at KFC, a role I left in 2023 
            to focus on my VCE studies. Most recently, I developed a math learning game that helps users practice times tables. 
            The game allows users to select numbers from 1 to 12 and cycles through different multiplication problems for targeted learning. 
            This project not only enhanced my programming skills but also strengthened my problem-solving and user interface design abilities.

        <p>
            After I finish my diploma and bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity, I plan to join my brother at Commonwealth Bank as a 
            cybersecurity personnel. I am particularly interested in working on the policy side of cybersecurity, where I can help 
            develop and enforce security protocols to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with industry standards. <br><br>
            My goal is to contribute to creating a safer digital environment within the banking sector, while continuously expanding 
            my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. Ultimately, I would like to grow into a leadership role where I can influence 
            security strategies on a larger scale and help shape the future of cybersecurity in the financial industry.
