            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Ammandeep — a 19-year-old with a passion for coding, gaming, and the gym.
                From a young age, I’ve always been a gamer. I played my first game at just 5 years old on my cousin’s GameCube, 
                and that moment sparked a lifelong love for gaming. Today, I’m an avid Call of Duty player, but Minecraft will always have 
                a special place in my heart. My journey into coding began when I discovered my fascination with computers and how they work. 
                With the encouragement of my teachers and my first experience using Scratch, I was inspired to dive deeper into programming. 
                Python became my go-to language, and since then, I’ve built many projects and continue to sharpen my coding skills every day.
                Fitness is also a major part of my life. I was drawn to the gym at 14 after being amazed by people lifting heavy weights. 
                I got my first gym membership at 16, and within my first year, I reached a 100kg bench press and a 170kg deadlift — thanks to 
                the support of my friends. The gym is more than just training for me; it’s a place to relieve stress, grow stronger, and help 
                others on their journey too.

    <h2>Future Ambitions</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, I endeavour to become a cybersecurity professional. From a young age, I developed a strong passion for information technology 
        and its many areas. This interest deepened when my brother began studying cybersecurity—he introduced me to the field and showed me how 
        fascinating and important it is. Ever since then, I’ve been determined to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
        <br><br>
        To work towards this goal, I’m currently studying a Diploma of Cybersecurity at La Trobe University. Next year, I will be progressing into the 
        second year of the Bachelor of Cybersecurity program, also at La Trobe. Alongside my studies, I plan to begin applying for internships 
        to gain practical, hands-on experience in the field.
        <br><br>
        As I move forward, I aim to develop my coding skills and deepen my understanding of cybersecurity concepts such as network security, 
        ethical hacking, and risk management. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to protecting individuals and organisations from digital threats 
        and play a role in creating a safer online world. While I have a clear focus on cybersecurity, I remain open to exploring the different 
        specialisations within the field as I gain more experience.
