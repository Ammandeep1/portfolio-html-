            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a motivated 19-year-old currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in cyber security. With a strong passion for both fitness and all 
                areas of Information Technology, I dedicate at least five days a week to the gym, and the rest to advancing my academic and professional 
                goals. I’m a hardworking, adaptable individual who thrives in team environments and builds strong connections with others. 
                I also have a solid understanding of Microsoft Word and Excel, having worked with both programs since the age of 10.
                <br><br>
                The gym has been a core part of my life since the age of 16, serving as a space for both physical and personal growth. 
                It has helped me develop emotional resilience, discipline, and strong interpersonal skills through consistent training and social interaction. 
                I’ve built meaningful connections, supported others in their fitness journeys, and frequently provided guidance on proper exercise techniques. 
                These experiences have strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, lead by example, and stay motivated through challenges 
                in both work and life.

    <h2>Future Ambitions</h2>
    <p>
        In the future, I endeavour to become a cybersecurity professional. From a young age, I developed a strong passion for information technology 
        and its many areas. This interest deepened when my brother began studying cybersecurity—he introduced me to the field and showed me how 
        fascinating and important it is. Ever since then, I’ve been determined to pursue a career in cybersecurity.
        <br><br>
        To work towards this goal, I’m currently studying a Diploma of Cybersecurity at La Trobe University. Next year, I will be progressing into the 
        second year of the Bachelor of Cybersecurity program, also at La Trobe. Alongside my studies, I plan to begin applying for internships 
        to gain practical, hands-on experience in the field.
        <br><br>
        As I move forward, I aim to develop my coding skills and deepen my understanding of cybersecurity concepts such as network security, 
        ethical hacking, and risk management. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to protecting individuals and organisations from digital threats 
        and play a role in creating a safer online world. While I have a clear focus on cybersecurity, I remain open to exploring the different 
        specialisations within the field as I gain more experience.
